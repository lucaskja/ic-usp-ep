# Holdout Method for Model Evaluation

## Overview

This project uses the Holdout method to ensure robust evaluation of our MobileNetV2 improvements. This document explains how the data is separated and processed during training and evaluation.

## Holdout Method Implementation

### What is the Holdout Method?

The Holdout method is a simple validation technique where the dataset is split into two parts: a training set and a validation set. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set.

### Our Implementation

We use an 80/20 split in our experiments, which means:

1. The dataset is divided into two parts:
   - 80% of the data is used as the training set
   - 20% of the data is used as the validation set
2. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set
3. This provides a clear separation between training and validation data

### Implementation Details

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the dataset into training and validation sets
train_indices, val_indices = train_test_split(
    range(len(dataset)), 
    test_size=0.2, 
    random_state=42, 
    stratify=[dataset[i][1] for i in range(len(dataset))]  # Stratify by class labels
)

# Create data loaders
train_sampler = torch.utils.data.SubsetRandomSampler(train_indices)
val_sampler = torch.utils.data.SubsetRandomSampler(val_indices)

train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    dataset, 
    batch_size=batch_size, 
    sampler=train_sampler
)

val_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    dataset,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    sampler=val_sampler
)

# Initialize model
model = initialize_model()

# Train model
train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, num_epochs)

# Evaluate model
accuracy = evaluate_model(model, val_loader)
print(f"Validation accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

## Benefits of the Holdout Method in Our Project

1. **Simplicity**: The Holdout method is straightforward to implement and understand.

2. **Computational Efficiency**: Only requires training the model once, making it faster than cross-validation methods.

3. **Clear Separation**: Maintains a clear separation between training and validation data.

4. **Fair Comparison**: When comparing different model architectures (base MobileNetV2 vs. our improvements), using the same train/validation split ensures a fair comparison.

## Final Test Evaluation

After selecting the best model based on the validation results, we perform a final evaluation on a separate test set that was not used during the training process. This provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.
