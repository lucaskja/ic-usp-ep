### Differences Between Implementations

The main difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations appears to be in the batch normalization layers, accounting for approximately 34,112 parameters (0.96% of the total). This difference is likely due to:

1. Different default initialization strategies for batch normalization parameters
2. Slight architectural variations in how batch normalization is implemented
3. Different handling of the moving averages in batch normalization layers

Despite these minor differences, both implementations are functionally equivalent and produce models of the same size (13.50 MB).

## Implications for Research Project

For the leaf disease classification project using MobileNetV2 improvements:

1. **Consistency**: The parameter counts are consistent enough that research findings should be comparable across frameworks.

2. **Reproducibility**: When reporting results, it's important to specify which framework was used, as there is a small but measurable difference in parameter count.

3. **Performance**: The 0.96% difference in parameters is unlikely to cause significant performance variations between implementations.

4. **Improvements**: The proposed improvements (Mish activation, Triplet Attention, and CNSN) should provide similar benefits regardless of whether they're implemented in PyTorch or TensorFlow.

## Conclusion

The PyTorch implementation of MobileNetV2 used in this project has 3,504,872 parameters, which is 0.96% fewer than the TensorFlow reference implementation. This difference is minimal and primarily located in the batch normalization layers. For research purposes, both implementations can be considered equivalent, with the choice of framework being more dependent on ecosystem compatibility and developer preference than on model architecture differences.
